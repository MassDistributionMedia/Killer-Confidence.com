####To Do
- Docpad isn't running right in the current code. It may be becasue the translation from the html2coffeekup module's output wasn't the best. We can either write /src/layouts/default.html.coffee in html.eco or start fresh from a new Docpad skeleton. If this takes more than two hours to setup then don't use @content in default.html.eco/coffee and just put the entire index.html into default.html.eco/coffee.

- Feel free to add things To Do here or as Github issues.
