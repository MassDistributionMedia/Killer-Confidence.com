She will discuss her personal issues as a part of a larger campaign called &quot;Love is Louder than the Pressure to Be Perfect&quot;, directed towards teen girls.  In 2012, Lovato was named the new Ambassador of </span><span class="c2 c0">Mean Stinks</span><span class="c2">, an anti-bullying campaign to inspire students to &quot;gang up for good&quot; against girl-to-girl bullying.

In response to a </span><span class="c9"><a class="c4" href="http://news-briefs.ew.com/2012/05/03/vogue-bans-too-skinny-models-from-its-pages/">recent pledge</a></span><span class="c2"> by 19 </span><span class="c0">Vogue</span><span class="c2"> editors to no longer hire models with visible signs of an eating disorder, Tyra Banks wrote an open letter to Vogue to talk about her own experiences in the modeling industry and about the pressures facing young women who currently work within the industry.<br><br>The </span><span class="c0">America&#39;s Next Top Model</span><span class="c2"> creator/host also revealed that, after working as a runway model for years, designers and agencies no longer wanted to hire her when she began to develop curves in her early 20s. Instead of starving herself or quitting the industry altogether, Banks sat down with her mother and crafted a new career strategy that involved flaunting her shape rather than trying to fight against it. That choice eventually led her down the path of becoming a Victoria&#39;s Secret angel and a </span><span class="c0">Sports Illustrated</span><span class="c2"> cover girl.<br><br>Banks actively works to promote this idea of unique, personal beauty on </span><span class="c0">America&#39;s Next Top Model</span><span class="c2"> and in her own mentoring work with other young models. &quot;I’ve been using the word &#39;flawsome&#39; a lot. It’s you + your flaws + awesome = Flawsome. I have a big forehead, and I got made fun of all time. When I was a little girl, they used to call me “five-head.” I’ve been teased my whole life, but I continue to rock it with pride,&quot; she said.  Tyra is one fierce self-acceptance spokesperson and we think that’s rad!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"><strong>Ashley Judd</strong></span><img height="172" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHdiTVH4b4X8oCcuHRa1dtwcWWV2ra-xI09mvc7PeyQ/pubimage?id=1gHdiTVH4b4X8oCcuHRa1dtwcWWV2ra-xI09mvc7PeyQ&amp;image_id=1zP32i7QLuWi3WzLMK7CzI6FNqQn-Wh3WFk-n5WIoLH5xXA" width="172" style="float: left;
padding: 13px;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a barrage of nasty media speculation about the actress’s looks – everything from questions about possible plastic surgery to denigrating comments about her weight – Ms. Judd decided she needed to respond and issued an eloquently, and yet subtly scathing, written essay on </span><span class="c0">The Daily Beast:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">That women are joining in the ongoing disassembling of my appearance is salient. Patriarchy is not men. Patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. It privileges, inter alia, the interests of boys and men over the bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity of girls and women. It is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it. This abnormal obsession with women’s faces and bodies has become so normal that we (I include myself at times—I absolutely fall for it still) have internalized patriarchy almost seamlessly. We are unable at times to identify ourselves as our own denigrating abusers, or as abusing other girls and women.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ms. Judd is on fire with not only amazing beauty but also killer brains to boot!  And remember peeps, </span><span class="c2 c0">knowledge</span><span class="c2"> is power!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"><strong>Stacy London</strong></span><img height="182" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHdiTVH4b4X8oCcuHRa1dtwcWWV2ra-xI09mvc7PeyQ/pubimage?id=1gHdiTVH4b4X8oCcuHRa1dtwcWWV2ra-xI09mvc7PeyQ&amp;image_id=1XpmHoHaIMMVx-77tXB3T1yNVT_AjYblqiTJu84e2iVzhJw" width="182" style="float: left;

In a 2007 interview with Sirens magazine, she said of the experience &quot;I have been every size in my life. I’ve had lots of issues with body image and weight my whole life and it really took a great deal of work to recognize that at all those weights, no matter how I felt, I could still find a dress that made me feel sexy and powerful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"> In 2010, London was profiled by Time Out magazine in their article/photo series about the most stylish New Yorkers.  She discussed being single, the importance of personal style, and her past struggles with eating disorders in her second book, a memoir, titled The Truth About Style.  As a fashion icon, we’re psyched to see Stacy supporting a woman feelin’ hot ‘n sexy at any size!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"><strong>Tina Fey</strong></span><img height="121" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHdiTVH4b4X8oCcuHRa1dtwcWWV2ra-xI09mvc7PeyQ/pubimage?id=1gHdiTVH4b4X8oCcuHRa1dtwcWWV2ra-xI09mvc7PeyQ&amp;image_id=1yQiqw4NK3GqjXdRAeNj4A4xqBZJiLQJSHNyQ8L5-P4ixFQ" width="182" style="float: left;
