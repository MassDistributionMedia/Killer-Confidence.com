As the nation’s first residential eating disorder facility, now with eleven locations throughout the country, Renfrew has helped more than 60,000 women with eating disorders and other behavioral health issues.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1 c5">Renfrew provides women suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) and related mental health problems, with the tools they need to succeed — in recovery and in life. Offering a warm, nurturing environment, Renfrew emphasizes a respect for the unique psychology of women, the importance of a collaborative therapeutic relationship and the belief that every woman needs to actively participate in her own growth and recovery.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c5">The Renfrew Center supports the belief that there is never a single cause for the development of an eating disorder. Rather, eating disorders are complex illnesses with biological, genetic, psychological, social and developmental roots. Effective treatment must target this entire range of factors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c1 c5"><a class="c2" href="http://www.renfewcenter.com">www.renfewcenter.com</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c10">1-800-RENFREW (736-3739)</span></p><p class="c4 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c12"><span class="c9"></span></p>
